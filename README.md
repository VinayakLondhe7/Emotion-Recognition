# Emotion-Recognition
🔍 Project Title: Emotion Recognition

📊 Overview: This project focuses on recognizing emotions from speech using the Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS) dataset. 

Key steps included:
1. Loading and preprocessing data
2. Extracting features using MFCC
3. Building and training an LSTM model
4. Evaluating the model with accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix

💻 Tools & Technologies: Python, Keras, Librosa, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

🧠 What I Learned:
1. Advanced techniques in speech signal processing
2. Implementation of deep learning models
3. Practical experience with real-world datasets
